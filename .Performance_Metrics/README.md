## 💡 Key Recommendations

Based on these test results:

1. **✅ Always use local installation source when possible**
   - Copy ZIP to local temp directory before installation
   - Expect 77% faster installation (5m 10s saved)

2. **✅ Use silent installation parameters**
   - Eliminate user-interactive delays
   - Automate large-scale deployments

3. **✅ Optimize network shares (if UNC required)**
   - Enable SMB multichannel and SMB3
   - Expect 5+ minute penalty vs local installation

4. **📊 Collection performance is independent**
   - Device collection times identical regardless of installation source
   - Performance determined by device complexity
